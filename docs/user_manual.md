Make sure you file your booking under the right `CLASS` (e.g. `THESIS SEMINAR`,
`LAB MEETING`, `TALK` etc.).  Once a request is submitted, your slot/venue is
blocked and an email is sent your way. 

You can update your booking by visiting ==:fa-bars: -> My Bookings==.

!!! note "Recurrent Event"
    To make recurrent booking (maximum for 6 months), select appropriate
    days in __select days__ list. To limit your booking to some weeks such
    as first and third of every month, select those weeks (==Hold down
    `Ctrl` keys when selecting multiple entries.==).

    Don't worry, you can always delete your booking requests in case of
    error.
